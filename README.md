# Beancord
Cool chatting app made with Python and Kivy. It also stores your messages so that you can continue your convos where you left off. To run both the server and app you will need to install the Python Interpreter.

## Running the app
Open a Terminal/Command Prompt in the folder where you downloaded this repository and run this command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, run the app by going into the `app` folder and running `main.py`.

## Running a server
To run a server, go into the `server` folder and run `main.py`. Your messages are stored in an SQLite Database with the name `db.sqlite3`.
